title: "Wake Up Foods"
description: "Wake Up Foods is a website where people can buy ridiculously delicious waffles. It sounds simple and is really simple just the way a sharing economy venture should be. However, it does stand out from the crowd by making every aspect of e-shopping better. Creating this website, I aimed at communicating the simplicity, speed, and elegancy of modern shopping that only requires an internet connection."

### Project Goal
The goal was to build the best customer experience for everyone who wants to buy waffles.
<br />
<br />

### Solution
I worked to improve the look, feel and functionality of the website. I used a complete range of fidelity to support decision-making including sketches, user flows, wireframes, mockups and prototypes.
